  description="The Calendar Tetris Master treats full calendars as productivity. They fill every slot with back-to-back meetings, leaving no time for deep work or even basic breaks."
>
  <h2 class="section-title">The Pattern</h2>

  <p>
    The Calendar Tetris Master believes that a full calendar equals a productive
    day. Every slot is filled. Meetings start back-to-back. There's no time for
    focused work, bathroom breaks, or processing what was discussed. The
    calendar is a game of Tetris, and every gap must be filled.
  </p>

  <p>
    For knowledge workers — developers, designers, writers, strategists — this
    is devastating. Their core work requires extended periods of concentration.
    A morning fragmented by three 30-minute meetings isn't three blocks of
    productive time; it's zero blocks of deep work.
  </p>

  <p>
    The manager often believes they're helping by being accessible and involved.
    But what they're actually doing is preventing the work from getting done.
    Real work happens outside of meetings, but there's no "outside" when every
    slot is filled.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Why It Hurts</h2>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>Cal Newport's "Deep Work"</strong> research shows that peak
    productivity requires extended periods of distraction-free concentration.
    You can't achieve this in 25-minute chunks between meetings.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>Attention Residue</strong> (Sophie Leroy): When you switch tasks,
    your attention doesn't fully follow. The residue from the previous meeting
    dampens your performance on the next activity.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>Flow states require 15+ minutes</strong> to enter (McKinsey) and
    can increase productivity by 500%. Back-to-back meetings make flow
    impossible.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>392 hours per year</strong> — the time employees spend in meetings.
    That's 10 full work weeks before accounting for prep, follow-up, and
    recovery time.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>76% feel drained</strong> on meeting-heavy days. This isn't
    laziness; it's the documented cognitive cost of constant context switching.
  </div>

  <p>
    Paul Graham's "Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule" captures the core
    problem: makers need half-day blocks minimum to do meaningful work.
    "A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces
    each too small to do anything hard in."
  </p>

  <p>
    Developer productivity studies show that engineers getting only 2.3 hours of
    uninterrupted work in an 8-hour day. With 47 interruptions daily, each
    requiring 23 minutes to recover from, the math simply doesn't work.
  </p>

  <p>
    The result is that 51% of workers have to work overtime just to catch up
    on actual work. Real productivity happens before the meetings start or after
    they end — at personal expense.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">The Fix</h2>

  <ul class="fix-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Establish meeting-free blocks</strong> — Designate specific times
      for focused work and defend them like any other important meeting
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Create meeting-free days</strong> — No meetings Tuesdays and
      Thursdays, for example. Give everyone protected time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use office hours</strong> — Batch 1:1s and ad-hoc requests into
      designated times instead of accepting them whenever
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Default to shorter meetings</strong> — 25 minutes instead of 30,
      50 instead of 60. Parkinson's Law: work expands to fill available time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add buffer time</strong> — 5-10 minutes between meetings for
      transitions, notes, and mental reset
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Default to async</strong> — Before scheduling a meeting, ask if
      it could be a document, Slack thread, or video
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Audit recurring meetings</strong> — Every recurring meeting should
      justify its existence. Kill the ones that don't.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="section-title">If You're Affected</h2>

  <ul class="affected-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Block focus time</strong> — Put "deep work" blocks on your
      calendar and treat them as unmovable commitments
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Batch your meetings</strong> — Try to cluster meetings together
      to preserve larger blocks for focused work
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Suggest async alternatives</strong> — "Could we handle this in
      Slack?" is a valid response to many meeting requests
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Decline with rationale</strong> — "I need focus time for X
      project" is a legitimate reason to decline or reschedule
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use early mornings</strong> — Do deep work before the calendar
      fills up; protect your most productive hours
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Track your day</strong> — Visualize how fragmented your time
      actually is; the data can be persuasive
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Advocate for change</strong> — Share this research with your
      team; propose meeting-free experiments
    </li>
  </ul>
