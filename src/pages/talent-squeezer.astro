  tagline="Extracts maximum output without investing in growth"
  description="The Talent Squeezer treats employees as resources to be maximized, not people to be developed. They extract maximum output without investing in training, growth, or career development."
>
  <h2 class="section-title">The Pattern</h2>

  <p>
    The Talent Squeezer views their team as a resource to be optimized, not
    people to be developed. There's no budget for training. No career
    conversations. No stretch assignments. Just relentless pressure to produce
    more with less.
  </p>

  <p>
    When someone excels, they get rewarded with more work, not more opportunity.
    High performers get squeezed until they burn out or leave. Then the manager
    hires someone new and the cycle repeats.
  </p>

  <p>
    The mindset is short-term: extract value now, worry about sustainability
    later. But "later" arrives quickly. People leave. Knowledge walks out the
    door. Recruiting costs mount. The team that remains is exhausted and
    demoralized, watching their colleagues burn out and bail.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Why It Hurts</h2>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>$4.53 return for every $1</strong> invested in employee training,
    according to research. Motorola found a 33:1 ROI on their development
    programs.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>218% higher income per employee</strong> at companies that invest
    in training, according to the Association for Talent Development.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>50-200% of annual salary</strong> — the cost to replace an employee
    (Gallup). U.S. companies spent $900 billion on turnover in 2023.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>52% of employees</strong> reported burnout in 2024, with 40%
    pointing to "people shortages" (doing more with less) as the top cause.
  </div>

  <p>
    Self-Determination Theory identifies "competence" as a basic psychological
    need. People need to feel they're growing and mastering new skills. When
    this need is denied, intrinsic motivation dies, and burnout accelerates.
  </p>

  <p>
    The math is clear: investing in development is dramatically cheaper than
    replacing burned-out employees. A training budget of $5,000 per person costs
    far less than the $50,000-$100,000 required to replace someone who leaves.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the harm goes beyond economics. Knowledge hoarding, stagnant skills,
    and no advancement path create a toxic environment where your best people
    start looking elsewhere — and they find opportunities quickly.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">The Fix</h2>

  <ul class="fix-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Budget for development</strong> — 10-15% of work time for
      learning, conferences, courses, side projects
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hold career conversations</strong> — Regular discussions about
      growth goals, not just performance metrics
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Create promotion paths</strong> — Clear criteria for advancement
      so people can see a future
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Offer stretch assignments</strong> — Opportunities to learn new
      skills and take on new challenges
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Recognize contributions</strong> — Acknowledge impact, share
      credit, celebrate wins publicly
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Maintain sustainable pace</strong> — Don't reward unsustainable
      heroics; model healthy boundaries
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Conduct exit interviews</strong> — Learn why people leave and
      address root causes
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Share the ROI data</strong> — Make the business case for
      investment in people
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="section-title">If You're Affected</h2>

  <ul class="affected-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Ask for development</strong> — Request specific training,
      conference budget, learning time. Make the ask concrete.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Document your contributions</strong> — Keep records of your
      impact for performance reviews and future interviews
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Set boundaries</strong> — Sustainable pace, not burnout heroics.
      Your health isn't worth their deadline.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Network externally</strong> — Build relationships outside your
      team; don't let your professional world shrink
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Invest in yourself</strong> — If your employer won't invest in
      your growth, do it yourself
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Know your worth</strong> — Understand your market value; don't
      let loyalty become exploitation
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Plan your exit</strong> — If nothing changes after raising
      concerns, have a timeline for leaving
    </li>
  </ul>
