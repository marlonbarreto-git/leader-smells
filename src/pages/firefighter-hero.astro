  <h2 class="section-title">The Pattern</h2>

  <p>
    The Firefighter Hero is addicted to crisis. They allow known problems to
    fester until they become emergencies, then step in at the last moment to
    "save the day." They're celebrated for their heroic problem-solving while
    the team lives in constant emergency mode.
  </p>

  <p>
    Prevention work is invisible and unrewarded. Building monitoring? That
    doesn't get promotions. Writing documentation? Nobody notices. But pulling
    an all-nighter to fix a production outage? That's visible. That gets
    recognition. That makes you the hero.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes the pattern is unconscious — the manager genuinely thrives on
    adrenaline and doesn't see the harm. Sometimes it's more deliberate —
    they've learned that firefighting is how you prove value. Either way,
    the team suffers while the hero shines.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Why It Hurts</h2>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>Psychological safety</strong> is the #1 factor in high-performing
    teams (Google research). Blame-focused environments cause delayed incident
    reporting, hidden information, and prolonged outages.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>Blameless postmortem culture</strong> enables learning, produces
    honest reporting, and focuses on systemic improvement. Organizations
    adopting it see improved MTTR and reduced incident frequency.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>Amy Edmondson's research</strong> shows teams with psychological
    safety openly acknowledge errors and discuss prevention. Teams without it
    hide mistakes, ensuring they repeat.
  </div>

  <p>
    The perverse incentive problem is real. Organizations often reward
    firefighting more than fire prevention. The "availability heuristic" makes
    dramatic rescues more memorable than quiet maintenance. Heroes who save the
    day get promoted; engineers who prevent problems are invisible.
  </p>

  <p>
    This creates dependency and fragility. Only the hero can fix things. Only
    the hero knows the system. The team never develops capability because
    they're never given the chance to solve problems themselves. And the same
    types of crises keep recurring because nobody invests in prevention.
  </p>

  <p>
    The stress on the team is enormous. Constant emergencies lead to burnout.
    The emotional rollercoaster of crisis → rescue → brief calm → crisis is
    exhausting. Good people leave, making the remaining team even more
    dependent on the hero.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">The Fix</h2>

  <ul class="fix-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Reward prevention</strong> — Celebrate avoided incidents, not
      just resolved ones. Make invisible work visible.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Practice blameless postmortems</strong> — Focus on systems, not
      individuals. Ask "what failed?" not "who failed?"
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Track recurring issues</strong> — If it happened twice, invest
      in preventing a third time. Pattern recognition is key.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Invest in resilience</strong> — Automation, monitoring,
      redundancy. Prevention infrastructure is cheaper than repeated crises.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Spread knowledge</strong> — No one person should be the only one
      who can fix things. Document, cross-train, rotate.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Measure Mean Time Between Failures</strong> — Not just Mean Time
      To Recovery. Track how often things break, not just how fast you fix them.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Question hero patterns</strong> — If the same person always saves
      the day, ask why. What's preventing others from stepping up?
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="section-title">If You're Affected</h2>

  <ul class="affected-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Document recurring issues</strong> — Build the evidence that
      prevention is needed. Data makes patterns undeniable.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Propose systemic fixes</strong> — After each incident, recommend
      prevention measures. Put them in writing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Avoid hero dependency</strong> — Cross-train so you're not the
      only one who can fix things. Spread knowledge deliberately.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Advocate for blameless culture</strong> — Share research on
      psychological safety. Make the case for learning over blame.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Track the pattern</strong> — Note when crises are "allowed" to
      develop. Are they really unavoidable?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Protect yourself</strong> — Don't burn out being the only
      firefighter. Set limits on after-hours availability.
    </li>
  </ul>
