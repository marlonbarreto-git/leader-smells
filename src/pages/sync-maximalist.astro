  tagline="Everything must be a meeting, async communication is forbidden"
  description="The Sync Maximalist believes every discussion requires a meeting. They can't communicate asynchronously, creating calendar gridlock and preventing deep work."
>
  <h2 class="section-title">The Pattern</h2>

  <p>
    The Sync Maximalist defaults to meetings for everything. A question that
    could be answered in Slack? "Let's hop on a quick call." A decision that
    could be made via a document? "Let's schedule a meeting to discuss." One-way
    information that could be a Loom video? "I'll present this in our sync."
  </p>

  <p>
    Their calendar — and therefore everyone's calendar — becomes a wall of
    back-to-back meetings. There's no time for deep work. The irony is that
    meetings often create more meetings: alignment meetings, follow-up meetings,
    meetings to discuss what was decided in other meetings.
  </p>

  <p>
    For distributed teams, this pattern is especially harmful. Sync-heavy
    culture punishes different time zones and excludes anyone who can't attend
    in real-time. Critical information gets shared only with those present,
    creating knowledge silos.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Why It Hurts</h2>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>78% of workers</strong> say they're expected to attend too many
    meetings, according to an Atlassian survey of 5,000 knowledge workers.
    Meetings were identified as the #1 barrier to productivity.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>392 hours per year</strong> — the time employees spend in meetings
    (10 full work weeks). This doesn't include prep, follow-up, or
    context-switching costs.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>51% of workers</strong> have to work overtime at least a few days
    per week due to meeting overload. For directors and above, it's 67%.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>76% feel drained</strong> on days when they have a lot of meetings.
    Meeting fatigue is real and measurable.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>35% of all meetings</strong> are considered a waste, and 80% of
    workers say most meetings could be done in half the time.
  </div>

  <p>
    Research on async-first companies like GitLab, Basecamp, and Doist shows
    that asynchronous communication can boost productivity by nearly 60% while
    reducing burnout. Cutting meetings by 40% can increase productivity by up
    to 71% (Harvard Business Review).
  </p>

  <p>
    The issue isn't that meetings are bad — it's that they're overused.
    Synchronous time is expensive and should be reserved for activities that
    genuinely require real-time interaction: brainstorming, relationship
    building, sensitive conversations, complex negotiations.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">The Fix</h2>

  <ul class="fix-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Default to async</strong> — Before scheduling a meeting, try
      writing a document, Slack message, or recording a Loom video
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Audit recurring meetings</strong> — For each one, ask: "Could
      this information be shared asynchronously?"
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Require agendas</strong> — No agenda, no meeting. This forces
      clarity about what actually needs synchronous time
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use shorter defaults</strong> — 25 or 50 minutes instead of 30
      or 60. Parkinson's Law: work expands to fill available time
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Establish meeting-free days</strong> — No meetings on Tuesdays
      and Thursdays gives everyone protected focus time
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Document decisions</strong> — Every meeting should produce written
      outcomes that people who weren't there can read
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Office hours</strong> — Replace individual meeting requests with
      scheduled availability blocks
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="section-title">If You're Affected</h2>

  <ul class="affected-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Decline with alternatives</strong> — "I can respond async — can
      you share this in Slack instead?"
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Block focus time</strong> — Put "deep work" blocks on your
      calendar and treat them as unmovable
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Request agendas</strong> — Before accepting, ask what the
      meeting is for and what decisions will be made
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Suggest async tools</strong> — Loom for demos, docs for decisions,
      Slack threads for quick questions
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Calculate the cost</strong> — Show your manager the productivity
      math: each meeting costs everyone 23+ minutes to recover
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Propose experiments</strong> — "What if we tried async standups
      for two weeks and measured the results?"
    </li>
  </ul>
