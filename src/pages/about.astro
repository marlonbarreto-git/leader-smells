  <h1>About Leader Smells</h1>

  <h2>Why This Exists</h2>

  <p>
    In software development, we have "code smells" — patterns that suggest
    something might be wrong. They're not bugs, but they often lead to bugs.
    Naming them gives us a shared vocabulary to discuss problems and improve.
  </p>

  <p>
    Leadership has the same patterns. Behaviors that seem normal but quietly
    destroy productivity, morale, and retention. The problem? Most people don't
    have words for them. When you can't name something, you can't discuss it.
    When you can't discuss it, you can't fix it.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Leader Smells</strong> gives names to these patterns. Each "smell"
    is documented with:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A clear description of the behavior</li>
    <li>Research explaining why it's harmful</li>
    <li>What good leaders do instead</li>
    <li>Advice for those affected by it</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Goal</h2>

  <p>
    This isn't about shaming anyone. Leadership is hard, and most problematic
    behaviors come from good intentions — wanting to stay informed, wanting to
    help, wanting to be involved.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal is to help people:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Recognize</strong> patterns in their own behavior</li>
    <li><strong>Name</strong> behaviors they're experiencing</li>
    <li><strong>Understand</strong> the research behind the harm</li>
    <li><strong>Improve</strong> with specific, actionable alternatives</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The tone is intentionally professional. You should feel comfortable sharing
    these pages with colleagues — or even your manager.
  </p>

  <h2>Research-Backed</h2>

  <p>
    Every claim on this site is backed by legitimate research: peer-reviewed
    studies, respected business publications (HBR, McKinsey), and foundational
    work from researchers like:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gloria Mark</strong> (UC Irvine) — interruption and context switching</li>
    <li><strong>Amy Edmondson</strong> (Harvard) — psychological safety</li>
    <li><strong>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</strong> — flow states</li>
    <li><strong>Edward Deci & Richard Ryan</strong> — self-determination theory</li>
    <li><strong>Edwin Locke & Gary Latham</strong> — goal-setting theory</li>
    <li><strong>Cal Newport</strong> — deep work and attention residue</li>
    <li><strong>Paul Graham</strong> — maker's schedule vs manager's schedule</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>About the Creator</h2>

  <p>
    Leader Smells was created by developers who've experienced these patterns
    firsthand. We believe that naming problems is the first step to solving them,
    and that better leadership creates better workplaces for everyone.
