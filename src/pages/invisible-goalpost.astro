  description="The Invisible Goalpost sets vague expectations and then moves them. Work is rejected with 'that's not what I meant' even when there was no clear specification."
>
  <h2 class="section-title">The Pattern</h2>

  <p>
    The Invisible Goalpost manager never commits to clear requirements. "Make
    it better." "It should be more professional." "I'll know it when I see it."
    Then, when the work is complete, they reject it because "that's not what
    I meant."
  </p>

  <p>
    Requirements are discovered during review, not planning. Acceptance criteria
    are revealed only after failing to meet them. The team learns that "done"
    is never done — there's always another round of changes, another shifted
    expectation, another goalpost that moved while you weren't looking.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes this stems from the manager genuinely not knowing what they want
    until they see it. Sometimes it's a way to maintain control — you can never
    be "right" if the target is invisible. Either way, the effect is wasted
    effort, frustrated teams, and eroded trust.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Why It Hurts</h2>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>Goal-Setting Theory</strong> (Locke & Latham), based on 50+ years
    of research, shows that clear, specific goals dramatically improve
    performance compared to vague goals or no goals.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>"A clear goal can be measured and leaves no room for
    misunderstanding."</strong> Goals direct attention, energize effort, and
    encourage persistence — but only when they're specific.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>Goal clarity reduces role ambiguity</strong>. When people know
    exactly what's expected, they can focus on execution instead of guessing.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>Psychological safety</strong> requires the ability to clarify
    expectations without fear. Moving goalposts punish this vulnerability.
  </div>

  <p>
    The fundamental problem is that you can't succeed against undefined success
    criteria. Every piece of work becomes a lottery. Did you guess correctly
    what the manager actually wanted? Only the review will tell.
  </p>

  <p>
    This destroys competence — one of the three basic psychological needs
    (Deci & Ryan). You can't feel effective when success criteria keep changing.
    The experience of mastery requires stable targets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Teams in this environment become risk-averse. Why invest creative energy
    when it will probably be rejected? Why take initiative when the rules aren't
    clear? The safest path is to wait for explicit instructions and change
    nothing without approval.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">The Fix</h2>

  <ul class="fix-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Define specific success criteria</strong> — Before work begins,
      document what "done" looks like. Be concrete.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Write it down</strong> — Requirements should exist in a shareable
      document, not just in conversation
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Check understanding</strong> — Ask "What does success look like
      for this?" and confirm alignment before starting
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Prototype early</strong> — Get feedback on direction before full
      execution. Fail fast, fail cheap.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Acknowledge changes</strong> — When requirements change, own it
      explicitly. Don't pretend the target was always there.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Accept good enough</strong> — Perfect is the enemy of done. Define
      minimum viable quality and ship it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Build psychological safety</strong> — Make it safe to ask
      clarifying questions without seeming incompetent
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="section-title">If You're Affected</h2>

  <ul class="affected-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Ask for specifics</strong> — "What would success look like
      specifically?" Push for concrete criteria.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Write it down</strong> — Email a summary of your understanding
      before starting: "So the requirements are X, Y, Z — correct?"
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Show progress early</strong> — Get feedback on direction before
      investing fully. A quick sketch can prevent wasted days.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Track changes</strong> — Document when requirements shifted.
      Build evidence of the pattern.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Request examples</strong> — "Can you show me something similar
      that worked?" Concrete examples clarify vague expectations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Name the pattern</strong> — "I notice the requirements have
      changed three times. Can we clarify before I continue?"
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Protect your work</strong> — Keep versions showing what was
      originally requested vs. what was eventually demanded
    </li>
  </ul>
