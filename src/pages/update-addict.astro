  tagline="Leaders who ask 'any updates?' instead of checking existing documentation"
  description="The Update Addict constantly interrupts their team asking for status updates instead of checking project tools, documentation, or PRs. This destroys productivity and creates an interrupt-driven culture."
>
  <h2 class="section-title">The Pattern</h2>

  <p>
    The Update Addict manager pings you multiple times per day with variations
    of "any updates?" They do this instead of checking the tools where updates
    already exist — Jira tickets, pull requests, Slack channels, documentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Their intentions are usually good: they want to stay informed, help remove
    blockers, and demonstrate involvement. But the impact is devastating. Each
    "quick question" rips you out of focused work, and the cumulative effect
    creates an interrupt-driven culture where real work happens in stolen
    moments between status requests.
  </p>

  <p>
    The worst part? Documentation becomes pointless. Why maintain a project
    board if nobody reads it? Why write detailed PR descriptions if the manager
    will just ask anyway? The team learns that the fastest path is to respond
    to interruptions, not to maintain information sources.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Why It Hurts</h2>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>23 minutes and 15 seconds</strong> — The average time to fully
    regain focus after an interruption, according to research by Gloria Mark
    at UC Irvine.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>12 context switches per 30 minutes</strong> — The average number
    of interruptions knowledge workers face, each one incurring a recovery
    penalty.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>47 interruptions per day</strong> — What developers experienced
    in a tracking study, leaving only 2.3 hours of focused work in an 8-hour
    day.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>500% productivity boost</strong> — What flow states can deliver
    according to McKinsey research. But flow requires 15+ minutes of
    uninterrupted time to enter, and one "quick question" can break it
    instantly.
  </div>

  <p>
    Paul Graham captured this perfectly in his essay
    <a href="https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      "Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule"</a
    >:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    "A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two
    pieces each too small to do anything hard in."
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The research is clear: interruptions don't just cost the time of the
    interruption itself. They create "attention residue" where your mind is
    still processing the previous task. The more interruptions, the more bugs,
    the lower the code quality, the higher the technical debt.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">The Fix</h2>

  <ul class="fix-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Define information sources</strong> — Establish where status
      lives (Jira, standups, weekly updates) and commit to checking there first
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Go async by default</strong> — Ask questions in Slack or email
      where they can be answered when convenient, not instantly
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Batch questions</strong> — Save non-urgent queries for scheduled
      1:1s or check-ins instead of pinging whenever a thought arises
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Trust the team</strong> — If something is blocked, trust that
      people will surface it without being asked
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Office hours</strong> — Designate specific times for synchronous
      questions, protecting focus time the rest of the day
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Calculate the cost</strong> — Recognize that each "quick check-in"
      costs the team 23+ minutes of recovery time
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="section-title">If You're Affected</h2>

  <ul class="affected-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Protect focus time</strong> — Block calendar time for deep work
      and defend it
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Set communication expectations</strong> — "I check Slack at 10am,
      2pm, and 5pm" gives a clear response window
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pre-empt questions</strong> — Send proactive updates before being
      asked; daily standup messages can preemptively answer questions
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Point to documentation</strong> — When interrupted, kindly
      redirect to where the answer already exists
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Have a conversation</strong> — Share this research; many Update
      Addicts don't realize the impact
    </li>
  </ul>
