  <h1>Contribute</h1>

  <p>
    Leader Smells is an open project. If you've experienced a leadership
    anti-pattern that isn't covered, or have research to add, we want to hear
    from you.
  </p>

  <h2>Suggest a New Smell</h2>

  <p>
    The best leader smells are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Specific</strong> — A clear, recognizable behavior pattern</li>
    <li><strong>Research-backed</strong> — Has evidence showing it's harmful</li>
    <li><strong>Fixable</strong> — There's a better alternative</li>
    <li><strong>Professional</strong> — Can be shared in a work context</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To suggest a new smell:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/marlonbarreto-git/leader-smells/issues/new?template=new-smell.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        Open a GitHub issue
      </a>
      with the "New Smell" template
    </li>
    <li>Include a catchy name and one-line description</li>
    <li>Describe the pattern in 2-3 paragraphs</li>
    <li>Link to at least 2 supporting sources (studies, HBR, etc.)</li>
    <li>Suggest what good leaders do instead</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Improve Existing Content</h2>

  <p>
    Found a typo? Have a better source? Want to improve the explanation?
  </p>

    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/marlonbarreto-git/leader-smells" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

      </a>

      </a>
      describing the improvement
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Add Resources</h2>

  <p>
    Know a book, paper, or talk that should be on the
    <a href="/resources">Resources page</a>? Open an issue or PR with:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Title and author</li>
    <li>Why it's relevant to leadership anti-patterns</li>
    <li>A working link</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Guidelines</h2>

  <p>
    All contributions should:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Be professional</strong> — This content should be shareable in a
      work context, even with managers
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Be evidence-based</strong> — Claims need legitimate sources
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Be actionable</strong> — Include what to do instead
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Be kind</strong> — The goal is improvement, not shaming
    </li>
  </ul>
