  tagline="Changes priorities constantly, everything is always urgent"
  description="The Priority Spinner can't commit to a direction. They change focus daily or weekly, declare everything urgent, and leave a trail of half-finished work."

  <h2 class="section-title">The Pattern</h2>

  <p>
    The Priority Spinner changes direction based on the latest stakeholder
    request, customer complaint, or shiny idea. Last week's "top priority"
    is forgotten as a new "critical urgent" project takes its place. Everything
    is labeled urgent, which means nothing is.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sprint planning becomes theatre. Why invest in estimation and commitment
    when priorities will change mid-sprint anyway? The team learns that roadmaps
    are fiction and that the real priority is whatever the manager is currently
    excited about.
  </p>

  <p>
    The result is a landscape of half-finished features, abandoned initiatives,
    and accumulating technical debt from work that was started but never
    completed properly. The team is always busy, always stressed, but rarely
    shipping completed work.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Why It Hurts</h2>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>Work In Progress limits</strong> from Kanban research show that
    the more tasks teams juggle simultaneously, the longer everything takes.
    Little's Law proves mathematically: more WIP = longer lead times.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>Change fatigue</strong> is documented exhaustion from constant
    adaptation to new situations. It results from "continuous change without
    adequate time for people to adjust or see benefits."
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>50-70% of change initiatives fail</strong> according to research,
    partly because organizations don't give changes enough time to take root.
  </div>

  <div class="study-ref">
    <strong>Flow states require clear goals</strong>. Csikszentmihalyi's
    research shows you can't enter flow when the target keeps moving. Priority
    spinning makes the 500% productivity boost of flow impossible.
  </div>

  <p>
    Each priority change also incurs context switching costs. When you interrupt
    work on Project A to start Project B, you lose 23+ minutes to refocus.
    Project A also leaves "attention residue" — your mind keeps processing
    the unfinished work, further reducing your effectiveness on Project B.
  </p>

  <p>
    The cumulative effect is that nothing ships. The team is exhausted from
    constant pivoting, demoralized by abandoned work, and cynical about any
    stated priority. "Urgent" becomes meaningless.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">The Fix</h2>

  <ul class="fix-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Set WIP limits</strong> — Commit to finishing work before starting
      new work. Kanban's core principle is "stop starting, start finishing."
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Plan in quarters</strong> — Establish priorities for a meaningful
      period and commit to them. Not everything is a sprint.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Learn to say no</strong> — New requests go in a backlog for next
      planning cycle. Protect current work from scope creep.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Stack rank priorities</strong> — If everything is #1, nothing is.
      Force a clear ordering, then respect it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Quantify switching costs</strong> — Calculate how much productivity
      is lost each time direction changes
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reserve buffer for true emergencies</strong> — Keep 10-20%
      capacity unplanned to handle genuine urgent issues
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hold retrospectives</strong> — Review how often priorities changed
      and why. Learn from patterns.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="section-title">If You're Affected</h2>

  <ul class="affected-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Clarify in writing</strong> — "So to confirm, X is now higher
      priority than Y?" Get explicit acknowledgment of the change.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Track the pivots</strong> — Keep a log of priority changes with
      dates. Data makes the pattern visible.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Quantify impact</strong> — Calculate hours lost to context
      switching and abandoned work
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Propose stability</strong> — "What if we committed to these
      priorities for 2 weeks and measured results?"
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Finish something</strong> — Push to complete at least one item
      fully before starting another
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Build alliances</strong> — Unite with teammates to advocate for
      focus; there's strength in numbers
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Protect deep work</strong> — Block time and defend it from the
      chaos of constantly shifting priorities
    </li>
  </ul>
