# The Invisible Goalpost - Research Notes

## Overview
Leaders who set unclear expectations, move targets, and say "that's not what I meant" after work is completed. This creates frustration, wasted effort, and erodes trust.

## Key Research & Sources

### Goal-Setting Theory (Locke & Latham)

**Foundational Research**
- Goal-setting theory developed through 50+ years of research
- Formalized in 1990, now seen as "one of the most influential frameworks in motivational psychology"
- Based on integration of hundreds of studies involving thousands of participants

**The Five Principles**
1. **Clarity** - Goals must be measurable and unambiguous
2. **Challenge** - Goals should be difficult but attainable
3. **Commitment** - Goals must be accepted
4. **Feedback** - Progress must be tracked
5. **Complexity** - Goals should match capability

- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232501090_A_Theory_of_Goal_Setting_Task_Performance

**Key Finding on Clarity**
- "Individuals who have specific, challenging, but attainable goals have better performance than those who set vague goals or do not set goals" (Latham, 2003)
- Students have better learning performance with clearer, more specific goals
- "A clear goal is one that can be measured and leaves no room for misunderstanding"

### How Goals Affect Performance

**Four Mechanisms (Latham & Locke)**
1. **Direction** - Goals direct attention and effort toward relevant activities
2. **Effort** - Challenging goals energize people
3. **Persistence** - Clear goals encourage working longer
4. **Strategy** - Goals prompt discovery of effective approaches

### Goal Clarity and Role Ambiguity

**Research Findings**
- Goal clarity helps employees know what is expected
- Reduces role ambiguity
- If belief in capacities is strong AND role ambiguity is low, higher performance follows
- Unclear goals create anxiety and wasted effort

### Psychological Safety (Amy Edmondson)

**Connection to Clear Expectations**
- Psychological safety = belief that you can speak up without punishment
- Unclear expectations make it unsafe to ask for clarification
- Fear of "that's not what I meant" creates anxiety about starting work
- Teams with psychological safety can clarify expectations openly

**Research on Team Learning**
- Teams need safety to acknowledge uncertainty
- "Saying, 'I need help. I'm not sure what to do here,' is a learning behavior"
- Moving goalposts punish this vulnerability

### Goal Commitment

**Key Moderator**
- "The goal-performance relationship is strongest when people are committed to their goals"
- Commitment requires clarity - you can't commit to a vague target
- Particularly important for difficult goals
- Moving goalposts destroy commitment because the target isn't real

### Self-Determination Theory Connection

**Competence Need**
- Deci & Ryan: Competence = perception of effectiveness and mastery
- Invisible goalposts deny the experience of competence
- You can't feel effective if success criteria keep changing
- Undermines intrinsic motivation

## The Pattern Description

The Invisible Goalpost manager:
- Gives vague instructions ("Make it better", "It should be more professional")
- Changes requirements after work is completed
- Says "that's not what I meant" frequently
- Won't commit to specific acceptance criteria
- Adds scope at the end ("Just one more thing")
- Moves deadlines without acknowledging the change
- Has different standards for different people or times

Symptoms:
- Work is frequently rejected or requires major rework
- Requirements are discovered during review, not planning
- Team is afraid to say work is "done"
- Multiple rounds of revisions that could have been avoided
- "I'll know it when I see it" approach to quality
- Post-hoc rationalization of shifting standards

## Why It Hurts

1. **Wasted Effort**: Work done to invisible specs gets thrown away
2. **Frustration**: Can't succeed when success is undefined
3. **Competence Denial**: Undermines basic psychological need
4. **Trust Erosion**: Team stops believing goals are real
5. **Quality Decline**: Without clear standards, quality varies randomly
6. **Anxiety**: Fear of the unknown "right answer" is stressful
7. **Initiative Death**: Why try if the target will move anyway?
8. **Communication Breakdown**: Unclear expectations spread confusion

## The Fix

1. **Specific Success Criteria**: Define "done" before work begins
2. **Write It Down**: Document requirements in shareable form
3. **Check Understanding**: "What does success look like for this?"
4. **Prototype Early**: Get feedback on direction before full execution
5. **Acknowledge Changes**: If requirements change, own it explicitly
6. **Accept Good Enough**: Perfect is the enemy of done
7. **Psychological Safety**: Make it safe to ask clarifying questions
8. **Retrospectives**: Review how often specs changed and why

## If You're Affected

1. **Ask for Specifics**: "What would success look like specifically?"
2. **Write It Down**: Email summary of your understanding before starting
3. **Confirm in Writing**: "So the requirements are X, Y, Z - correct?"
4. **Show Progress Early**: Get feedback before investing fully
5. **Track Changes**: Document when requirements shifted
6. **Request Examples**: "Can you show me something similar that worked?"
7. **Name the Pattern**: "I notice the requirements have changed three times"
8. **Protect Your Work**: Keep versions showing what was originally requested
