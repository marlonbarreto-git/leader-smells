# The Priority Spinner - Research Notes

## Overview
Leaders who change priorities constantly - daily or weekly - making everything urgent and creating chaos. Nothing gets finished, teams are exhausted, and focus becomes impossible.

## Key Research & Sources

### Work In Progress (WIP) Limits Research

**Kanban and Agile Research**
- WIP limits are one of the most powerful tools in Kanban
- Teams juggling too many tasks get overwhelmed with bottlenecks, context switching, and unfinished work
- The more work teams try to juggle at once, the harder it is to complete anything

**Little's Law (Mathematical Foundation)**
- Provides mathematical proof that limiting work in progress improves delivery performance
- Lead Time = Work in Progress / Throughput
- More WIP = Longer lead times, regardless of how hard people work

**Practical WIP Guidelines**
- Initiative Limits: 3-5 major projects at portfolio level
- Feature Limits: 8-12 features across teams at program level
- Story Limits: 15-20 stories in progress at team level
- Task Limits: 2-3 tasks per person at individual level

### Change Fatigue Research

**Definition**
- Change fatigue: mental and emotional exhaustion caused by constant adaptation to new situations, procedures, or expectations
- Results from continuous change without adequate time to adjust or see benefits

**Statistics**
- **78% of employees** expect constant change in their workplace (Capterra, 2022)
- **50-70% of planned change efforts fail**
- Only **43% of employees** believe their organization manages change effectively (down from ~60% in 2019)

### Flow State and Priority Disruption

**Csikszentmihalyi's Flow Research**
- Flow = state of energized focus, full involvement, enjoyment
- Flow requires: clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge-skill balance
- **Constantly changing goals make flow impossible** - you can't focus on a moving target

**McKinsey**
- Flow states increase productivity up to **500%**
- Priority changes destroy the conditions necessary for flow

### Organizational Change and Stress

**Research Findings**
- Due to continuous change, employees are pushed into "chronic state of emotional and physical depletion"
- Intensive organizational change leads to workplace incivility, fueled by stress
- Emotional exhaustion intensifies negative effects, creating toxic environments

**Employee Responses to Shifting Priorities**
- Worry about job security when priorities shift
- Rage when deadlines seem unreasonable
- Feeling out of control of work environment

### Context Switching Costs (Compounded by Priority Changes)

**Gloria Mark, UC Irvine**
- **23 minutes** to regain focus after interruption
- Workers experience **12 context switches** in 30 minutes
- Each priority change forces a context switch penalty

**Attention Residue (Sophie Leroy)**
- When switching from Task A to Task B, attention doesn't immediately follow
- Residue is especially thick when Task A was "unbounded and of low intensity" (i.e., interrupted)
- Performance is dampened by unfinished work lingering in mind

## The Pattern Description

The Priority Spinner:
- Changes focus weekly or daily based on latest stakeholder request
- Declares everything "urgent" and "top priority"
- Interrupts work in progress for new "critical" items
- Lacks a stable roadmap or clear strategic direction
- Reacts to every piece of feedback immediately
- Creates endless half-finished initiatives

Symptoms:
- Projects constantly get deprioritized before completion
- Team never celebrates wins because nothing ships
- Sprint planning is meaningless because priorities change mid-sprint
- Technical debt accumulates from abandoned work
- Team learns that "urgent" means "until something else is urgent"

## Why It Hurts

1. **Nothing Ships**: Half-finished work everywhere, no value delivered
2. **Context Switching Tax**: Each pivot costs 23+ minutes recovery
3. **Burnout**: Change fatigue leads to emotional and physical exhaustion
4. **Flow Impossible**: Can't enter flow when targets keep moving
5. **Technical Debt**: Abandoned features leave messy code
6. **Trust Erosion**: Team stops believing priorities matter
7. **Morale Collapse**: Constant churn without accomplishment is demoralizing
8. **Decision Fatigue**: Constantly re-prioritizing exhausts cognitive resources

## The Fix

1. **Set WIP Limits**: Commit to finishing before starting
2. **Quarterly Planning**: Establish priorities for a meaningful period
3. **Say No**: Learn to protect current work from new requests
4. **Stack Rank**: Clear priority order, not "everything is #1"
5. **Cost of Switching**: Quantify the cost of changing direction
6. **Buffer for Urgency**: Reserve capacity for true emergencies
7. **Retrospectives**: Review how often priorities changed and why
8. **Executive Alignment**: Get leadership buy-in to stable priorities

## If You're Affected

1. **Clarify in Writing**: "So to confirm, X is now higher priority than Y?"
2. **Track the Pivots**: Keep a log of priority changes
3. **Quantify Impact**: Calculate how many hours lost to context switching
4. **Propose Stability**: "What if we committed to these priorities for 2 weeks?"
5. **Finish Something**: Push to complete one item before starting another
6. **Build Allies**: Unite with teammates to advocate for focus
7. **Protect Deep Work**: Block time and defend it from priority chaos
