# The Update Addict - Research Notes

## Overview
Leaders who constantly ask "any updates?" instead of checking existing documentation, tickets, or PRs. This creates a culture of interruptions that devastates productivity.

## Key Research & Sources

### Context Switching Costs

**University of California, Irvine Study (Gloria Mark)**
- It takes an average of **23 minutes and 15 seconds** to fully regain focus after a significant interruption
- Knowledge workers are interrupted every **6-12 minutes** on average
- Workers experience an average of **12 context switches within a 30-minute work period**
- After only 20 minutes of repeating interruptions, people reported significantly higher stress, frustration, workload, effort, and pressure

**Qatalog and Cornell Study**
- Takes about **9.5 minutes** on average to get back into a productive workflow after toggling to a different digital app
- 45% of workers said toggling between too many apps makes them less productive
- 43% reported it's mentally exhausting to constantly switch between tools and contexts

**Harvard Business Review**
- Knowledge workers toggle between applications over **1,200 times per day**
- This costs roughly **four hours of productive time** daily
- Context switching consumes **45 to 90 minutes** of usable output each day

### Maker's Schedule vs Manager's Schedule

**Paul Graham Essay (2009)**
- "Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule" - foundational essay from Y Combinator founder
- Managers operate in one-hour blocks; makers need half-day blocks minimum
- "A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in"
- Solution: Office hours - cluster meetings at the end of the day

### Impact on Developers Specifically

**Developer Productivity Study**
- Tracking 50 developers over two weeks found an average of **47 interruptions per day**
- In an 8-hour day, engineers were only getting **2.3 hours of uninterrupted, focused work**
- Frequent breaks and interruptions correlate with **more bugs**, lower code maintainability, and increased technical debt

### Economic Impact
- Lost productivity due to context switching costs the global economy an estimated **$450 billion annually**

### Flow State Destruction

**McKinsey Research**
- Flow states can increase productivity up to **500%**
- Entering flow requires approximately **15 minutes of uninterrupted work**
- A single notification can instantly break this state

## The Pattern Description

The Update Addict manager asks "Any updates?" multiple times per day instead of:
- Checking project management tools (Jira, Linear, Asana)
- Reading existing documentation
- Looking at commit history or PRs
- Trusting their team to surface blockers proactively

This creates an interrupt-driven culture where:
- Workers are constantly pulled out of deep work
- Time is spent explaining progress rather than making progress
- Documentation becomes pointless because nobody reads it
- Team members learn to always appear busy

## Why It Hurts

1. **Productivity Loss**: Each "quick question" costs 23+ minutes of recovery time
2. **Quality Degradation**: Interrupted developers produce more bugs
3. **Stress & Burnout**: Constant interruptions increase stress, frustration, and mental exhaustion
4. **Flow State Prevention**: Workers never achieve the 500% productivity boost of flow
5. **Documentation Rot**: If nobody reads docs, nobody maintains them

## The Fix

1. **Establish Information Sources**: Define where status lives (Jira, standups, etc.)
2. **Async by Default**: Ask questions in Slack/email instead of interrupting
3. **Batch Questions**: Save non-urgent queries for scheduled check-ins
4. **Trust the Team**: If something is blocked, trust people to speak up
5. **Office Hours**: Designate specific times for synchronous Q&A

## If You're Affected

1. **Protect Focus Time**: Block calendar time for deep work
2. **Set Communication Expectations**: "I check Slack at 10am, 2pm, and 5pm"
3. **Pre-empt Questions**: Send proactive updates before being asked
4. **Document Religiously**: Point to documentation when interrupted
5. **Have a Conversation**: Share this research with your manager
