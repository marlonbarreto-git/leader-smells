## The Pattern Description

The Talent Squeezer:
- Views employees as resources to be maximized, not people to be developed
- Never invests in training, conferences, or learning time
- Expects maximum output without career growth conversations
- Keeps people in roles without advancement paths
- Takes credit for team accomplishments
- Replaces people when burned out rather than preventing burnout
- Hoards information to maintain dependency

Symptoms:
- No budget for professional development
- No career conversations or growth plans
- People leave after 1-2 years having learned nothing new
- High performers get more work, not more opportunity
- "You should be grateful to have a job" mentality
- Knowledge hoarding by managers

## Why It Hurts

1. **Turnover Costs**: Replacing people costs 50-200% of their salary
2. **Burnout**: Extracting without investing leads to exhaustion
3. **Knowledge Loss**: When people leave, institutional knowledge leaves
4. **Competence Starvation**: Denying development violates a basic human need
5. **Reputation Damage**: Word spreads; good candidates avoid the team
6. **Innovation Death**: Stagnant skills mean stagnant ideas
7. **Productivity Decline**: Burned out people produce less, make more mistakes

## The Fix

1. **Budget for Development**: 10-15% of time for learning
2. **Career Conversations**: Regular discussions about growth, not just performance
3. **Training Investment**: $4.53 return for every $1 spent is good ROI
4. **Promotion Paths**: Clear criteria for advancement
5. **Stretch Assignments**: Opportunities to learn new skills
6. **Recognition**: Acknowledge contributions, share credit
7. **Sustainable Pace**: Don't reward unsustainable output levels
8. **Exit Interviews**: Learn why people leave and address root causes

## If You're Affected

1. **Ask for Development**: Request specific training, conference budget
2. **Document Contributions**: Keep records of your impact
3. **Set Boundaries**: Sustainable pace, not burnout heroics
4. **Network Externally**: Build relationships outside your team
5. **Develop Yourself**: If employer won't invest, invest in yourself
6. **Know Your Worth**: Understand your market value
7. **Plan Your Exit**: If nothing changes, have a timeline for leaving
8. **Share the Data**: Present the ROI of development investment
